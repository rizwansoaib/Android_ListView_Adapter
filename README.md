- In Android development, any time we want to show a vertical list of scrollable items we will use a ListView which has data populated using an Adapter. The simplest adapter to use is called an ArrayAdapter because the adapter converts an ArrayList of objects into View items loaded into the ListView container.

- The ArrayAdapter fits in between an ArrayList (data source) and the ListView (visual representation) and configures two aspects:
Which array to use as the data source for the list How to convert any given item in the array into a corresponding View object
Note as shown above that there are other data sources besides an ArrayAdapter such as the CursorAdapter which instead binds directly to a result set from a Local SQLite Database.erences
